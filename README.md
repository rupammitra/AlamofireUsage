Added logging of Alamofire REQUESTS showing header and body parameters using Reqres https://github.com/AckeeCZ/Reqres and creating model objects and array right after getting response using AlamofireObjectMapper https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/AlamofireObjectMapper.

Will be adding support for PUT, DELETE requests and downloading, uploading soon.
